Image/IPTCInfo/TemplateFile version 0.02
========================================

Template files for IPTC IIM Text

VERSION
    This is version 0.2 - keywords and supplemental categories were not
    saved in the previous version.

DEPENDENCIES
            Image::IPTCInfo

DESCRIPTION
    Based on "Image::IPTCInfo" by Josh Carter (josh@multipart-mixed.com),
    this allows the loading of data from an IPTC template file, such as used
    by FotoStation(TM).

CONSTRUCTOR
    Pass an array, hash reference, array reference, or list.

    The IPTC text content can be obtained from a (clsoed) file, an file
    handle, or can be passe directly to the constructor.

    TO INSTANTIATE DIRECTLY
        To load IPTC data "manually", supply to the constructor any or all
        of the datafields whose names are defined as in the parent module
        (Image::IPTCInfo). Note that both the 'list' items "supplemental
        category" (*sic*) and "keywords" can be supplied as either a
        comma-delimited list or array references.

        Exmaple:

                Image::IPTCInfo::TemplateFile->new (
                        'caption/abstract' => 'The caption",
                        'keywords'         => 'keyword1,keyword2, keywordN',
                )

    TO INSTANTIATE FROM A TEMPLATE FILE
        Supply a "filepath" paramter, the path to a template file to open.
        This file should be just the first IPTC code: record 2, dataset 0,
        such as generated by this module or FotoStation(TM).

    TO INSTANTIATE FROM A FILE HANDLE
        Supply the paramter "FILE" as an open filehandle, from which we'll
        load, and then close. The file should already be at the start of the
        first IPTC code: record 2, dataset 0.

    When called, the constructor parses the template, filling a hash with
    the fields defined in "Image::IPTCInfo", a reference to which becomes
    this object.

    If no info is found, the object will be empty.

METHOD add_to_Image_IPTC_Info
    Transfers the data from the calling object to an "Image::IPTCInfo"
    object supplied in the only paramter.

    Returns true or "undef" if no object was supplied.
